## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is a **Web3-powered supply chain traceability system** that records every step a product goes through—from manufacturing to final delivery—directly on the blockchain.

With decentralized storage, NFTs, and smart contracts, each product's lifecycle becomes **unique, tamper-proof, verifiable, and permanently documented**, ensuring transparency and authenticity for all stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable full lifecycle tracking of products  
- Prevent fraud, counterfeits, and data manipulation  
- Offer transparent supply chain data to end users  
- Provide secure and decentralized information flow  
- Minimize reliance on manual entry and centralized systems

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum / Polygon / Any EVM-compatible chain  
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity  
- **Decentralized Storage:** IPFS / Filecoin  
- **Backend:** Node.js  
- **Frontend:** React.js / Next.js  
- **Wallet Integration:** MetaMask

---

## 🧩 System Workflow
1. **Product NFT Creation**  
   Every new product is minted on the blockchain as a unique identifier (NFT or unique ID).

2. **Lifecycle Updates Recorded On-Chain**  
   Each supply chain operation is signed and stored immutably:
   - Manufacturing  
   - Warehousing  
   - Transportation  
   - Shipping  
   - Customer Delivery

3. **Immutable Ledger**  
   No recorded data can be altered or deleted.

4. **Customer Verification**  
   When a user scans the QR code on the product, they can view:
   - Production details  
   - Storage and transport history  
   - Quality checks  
   - Delivery logs

   All data is verified on-chain in real time.

## 🧠 User Roles
| Role | Permissions |
|---|---|
| Manufacturer | Create product and initial tracking record |
| Warehouse | Update product status and location |
| Transporter | Log shipping and route details |
| Customer | Verify product authenticity and history |

---

## 🏗 Smart Contract Features
- Create product records  
- Add supply chain steps  
- Retrieve complete product history  
- Role-based access control

Since all updates are stored on-chain, **fraud and data manipulation are technically impossible.**

---

## 📱 Frontend Features
- Login with MetaMask  
- Product tracking dashboard  
- QR-based product lookup  
- Blockchain transaction viewer  
- Clean and Web3-friendly UI

---

## 🔍 Example Workflow
1. Manufacturer creates Product X → stored on blockchain  
2. Product shipped to warehouse → warehouse logs the event  
3. Transporter moves product → GPS/location data recorded  
4. Customer receives product  
5. Customer scans QR code → entire supply chain history displayed
